# Stochastic-Optimization
Make sure to 𝑝𝑖𝑝 𝑖𝑛𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑝𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑠, 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑦 and 𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑛𝑝𝑦𝑥𝑙 before running the project.
Make sure the excel file is in the same directory as the project file.
In the function: 𝑖𝑓 __𝑛𝑎𝑚𝑒__ == "__𝑚𝑎𝑖𝑛__": make sure to have 𝑖𝑛𝑝𝑢𝑡_𝑓𝑖𝑙𝑒 as your file name. If you want to overwrite the input file with the output file, meaning the result will be in the same file as the input, make sure to name your output file the same as the input file.
